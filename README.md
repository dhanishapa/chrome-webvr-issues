Chrome WebVR Issues
===================

This repository is home to the temporary issue tracker for Chrome's experimental WebVR support. It will probably dissapear once I figure out a cleaner way to track bugs against experiemental Chrome branches, at which point I'll be sure to migrate any bugs logged here over.
